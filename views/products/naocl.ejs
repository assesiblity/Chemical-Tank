        <h2>NAOCL (Sodium Hypochlorite) Chemical Tanks</h2>
        <p>
          Sodium hypochlorite solutions are very widely used within the water
          treatment industries. They are also used as a sterile bleach solution
          from the common domestic applications to the food industries to
          swimming pools. With the high levels of available chlorine, up to 15%,
          in a fresh solution, many thousands of tonnes are consumed on a
          regular basis.
        </p>
